## [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
- [Band Name Generator](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/Band%20Name): An earlier project to practice printing with input variables.
- [Add Two_Digit_Number](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/Add%20Two_Digit_Number): I learned how to use arrays to break a number into two, then use the type to ensure that I could add those two variables together.
- ["BMI Calculator"](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/%22BMI%20Calculator%22_1): I learned the importance between when tp use a float, and when to use an integer to create an equation out of variables.
- [Life in Weeks](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/Life%20In%20Weeks): This was my first time practicing f-strings.
- [Tip Calculator](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/Tip%20Calculator): Taking what I learned so far about input variables, types, and f-strings, I was able to create a functional tip calculator.
- [Even Odd](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/Even%20Odd): Practicing the use of Modulos.
- [Roller Coaster Tickets](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/Rollercoaster%20Tickets): Practicing if/elif/else.
- ["BMI 2.0 Calculator"](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/%22BMI%20Calculator%20%22_2): Using what I learned from if/elif/else to create another program that interprets information based on input.
- [Leap Year](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/Leap%20Year%20(IfElse)): This one was honestly a little tricky! [I realized that with the right set of limited input the program could easily *seem* accurate without being accurate.](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/Leap%20Year%20(Elif)) I had to run several tests to ensure that it hit all the parameters of "divisible by 4, **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder, **unless** the year is also divisble by 100 with no remainder." This project honestly made me excited to look forward to future tester work!
- [Love Calculator](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/Love%20Calculator): I took everything I had learned so far about input variables, types, strings, if/elif/else, and added count() to that to create this "calculator" that adds up the letters in a name to determine your match status.
- [Head Tails](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/Head%20Tails): My first implementation of inputing a module (random) and applying random.randint().
- [Pay Picker](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/Pay%20Picker):
- [Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/Rock%2C%20Paper%2C%20Scissors%2C%20Shoot!):
- [Max](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/Max):
- [The Gauss Challenge](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/The%20Gauss%20Challenge):
- [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/FizzBuzz):
- [Password Generator](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/Password%20Generator):
