        move()
    else:
        at_goal()

#notes: wouldnt function without an else.

#Teachers solution:
#while at_goal() != True:
#    if wall_in_front() == True:
#        jump()
#    else:
#        move()

#notes: this program is helping me to understand how more efficient code makes things run more efficiently. its less to process.
