# notes:
# i learned that just because a function has a certain lable,
# that does not always mean that that function works the way the lable sais it does.
# My greatest issue with Around 4 & Hurdle 4 is that front_is_clear(), right_is_clear(), wall_in_front(), and wall_on_right()
# didnt work the way that my mind logically believed they should operate as.
# There right could be obstructed, but it would still read as if it wasn't, and so.
# BUT this did give me a lot to test for and explore around.
