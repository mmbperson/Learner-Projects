year = int(input())

if year % 4 != 0:
  print("not leap year")
elif year % 100 == 0:
  print("Not leap year")
elif year % 400 == 0:
    print("Leap year")
else:
  print("Not leap year")

# Here, I learned that with elif, the program doesn't always run to the end. So, there can be a technical accuracy if it were to be accurate to a point, and so skip the last check. But what if that last check was the difference between the input being true or false? You've essentially created a "bind spot".
